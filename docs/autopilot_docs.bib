  abstract = {In this paper a sensor fusion algorithm is developed and implemented for detecting orientation in three dimensions. Tri-axis MEMS inertial sensors and tri-axis magnetometer outputs are used as input to the fusion system. A Kalman filter is designed to compensate the inertial sensors errors by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data. A tilt compensation unit is designed to calculate the heading of the system.},
