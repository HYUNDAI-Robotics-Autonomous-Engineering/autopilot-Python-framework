Connecting the Pilot
--------------------

If the ``TERMINAL_IP`` and port information is correctly set in the ``prefs.json`` file of the Pilot, it should automatically attempt to connect to the Terminal when it starts.
It will send a ``handshake`` message that lets the Terminal know of its existence, its IP address, and its state.
Once the Terminal receives its initial message, it should refresh, displaying a control panel for the pilot
