Autopilot - Distributed Behavior
*********************************

Autopilot is a Python framework to perform behavioral experiments with one or many `Raspberry Pis <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_.

For an overview of Autopilot's motivation, design, and structure, see our `whitepaper <https://auto-pi-lot.com/autopilot-paper.pdf>`_.

This documentation is very young and is very much a work in progress! Please `submit an issue <https://github.com/wehr-lab/autopilot/issues/new>`_ with any incompletenesses, confusion, or errors!
