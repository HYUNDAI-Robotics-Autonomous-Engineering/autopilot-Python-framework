# Temporary Hiatus

*updated May 28, 2020*

**Autopilot's development is on temporary hiatus due to covid-19.** Jonny is working on the People's Ventilator Project (https://github.com/CohenLabPrinceton/Ventilator-Dev), developing the GUI and UX for a supply-chain resistant emergency ventilator. 

After v1.0 enters FDA testing, Jonny will return to Autopilot with a huge update (that you can see in the `2to3` branch :). This will likely be mid-June.
