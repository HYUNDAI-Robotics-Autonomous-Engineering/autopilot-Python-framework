------------------
- Make verbose/nonverbose mode - either report whole trials or events
- Backfill logging into terminal & etc.

- classic mode, button that switches the UI to flickering grey screen
- sound calibration routine
- move all class references to __init__
- make batch mouse creation window
- add mouse infobox to left of plot
- make superclass of all "parameters-like" windows (windows that are a list of something.)
- implement sending continuous data in pilot.run_task
- routine to update git repo and restart on command
- make permissions safe.
- handshaking when pi connects to terminal - check IP, store status
- new pilot button is broken
- make control panel responsive to pi state
- clear last trigger on stop
- check for dupes on mouse lists
- unify param structure, make class
- change data ops with database ops using psycopg http://initd.org/psycopg/
- networking should probably just be router-only.
- give task object network node - send messages and handle task transitions directly from task.
- make hierarchical logging
- reinstate message receipts
- make pilot and jackclient quit nicely
- use ticks from pigpio triggers instead of generating timestamps from python
- see if can get ticks from jackd for sample processing time
- do 'interfaces' like https://www.expyriment.org/
- add Cython typing to jack client - https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/parallelism.html
- store pilot name in mouse object
